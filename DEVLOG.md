Living document tracking what we're building, why, and where we are.
Commit messages have the details — this has the narrative.

## Architecture (Oracle-validated 2026-03-13)

O1 was given the objective with zero context about our existing code.
It independently designed the same architecture we already built.
Confidence: 0.85. Full response: `docs/lab/oracle-v2-clean-room-response.json`

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Source |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 2026-03-13 | Strategic tier is model-agnostic, eval-gated | Don't hardcode O1 — any reasoning model can fill the tier | O3 Q1, GPT-5.4 Q1 |
| 2026-03-13 | Local-first architecture, raw API | pgvector + RRF beats Assistants API for our use case | All 3 models unanimous |
| 2026-03-13 | Claude Code is the orchestrator | Other models are tools it routes to, not competitors | User decision |
| 2026-03-13 | v2 strategic query contract (12-part) | Synthesized best of O3, GPT-5.4, Codex evaluations | docs/lab/model-eval/ |
| 2026-03-13 | Architecture validated by Oracle | O1 clean-room design converged on our existing architecture | oracle-v2-clean-room-response.json |
| 2026-03-13 | Goal 001: model optimization | Known-answer validation — draftbench predicts the outcome | goals/001-model-optimization.md |

## Current Status

### What's Built (all committed, all pushed)
- [x] Three nested loops (strategic → project → experiment)
- [x] v2 strategic query contract (12-part, with confidence threshold)
- [x] Upgraded system prompt (uncertainty contract, pre-mortem, adjudicator role)
- [x] Memory actions (strategist → skills DB feedback loop)
- [x] Unified LLM client (O1/O3 + Ollama + standard API)
- [x] State checkpointing with resume
- [x] Conventional commit hook
- [x] Oracle architecture validation
- [x] Goal 001 defined

### What's Next
- [ ] Wire draftbench `sweep.py` as a tool in `tools.py`
- [ ] Pull missing Ollama models (qwen2.5:1.5b, qwen2.5:32b)
- [ ] Build the 5-task benchmark suite for quality scoring
- [ ] Run Goal 001 end-to-end
- [ ] Validate convergence against draftbench predictions

### On Deck (not blocking)
- [ ] Extract GPT-5.4's eval harness into `ai-lab/evals/knowledge_plane/`
- [ ] Build the A/B retrieval comparison (local vs hosted)
- [ ] Add vector search to skills DB (currently tag-based)
- [ ] Observability beyond logging

## Model Evaluation Archive

Three OpenAI models (O3, GPT-5.4, Codex) were asked the same two questions.
Full responses in `docs/lab/model-eval/`. Summary:

| Model | Q1 (Protocol) | Q2 (Platform) | Notable |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| O3 | Drop-in schema delta | Tables + decision flow | Best operational answers |
| GPT-5.4 | Best essay, 5 archetypes | Full eval harness (2,691 lines) | Self-promoted as O1 replacement |
| Codex | Clean reframe | Direct "95%, skip it" | Most concise |
